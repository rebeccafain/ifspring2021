        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>My name is Rebecca Fain. I am a Junior double majoring in Operations & Supply Chain Management as well as Communication Design. I am pursuing a minor in the Business of Social Impact as well. </li>
                <li>I am taking this class as a requirement for the Com Des major. I chose this over the second level Word & Image course because I want to expose myself to new areas within Com Des. Coding is essential to producing digital content, and although I do not wish to professionally pursue it, I beleive hving a basic understanding/foundation in it will be helpful in more ways than I expect!</li>
                <li>Last spring I decided to take CS 131 (Java intro course) for reasons similar to why I chose to take this class. The class was extremely difficult for me and I ended up dropping it in March when we were sent home due to the pandemic (the withdrawl period was extennded). Long story short, coding is frightening to me and overwhelming but I am looking forward to this class as it seems much more intuitive and personal than my experience with the Comp Sci department in McKelvey. </li>
                <li>By the end of the semester, I hope to have a rudimentary knowledge of using html code and know its capabilities beyond what I can do with it. Overall, I hope to be able to have the skills to understand browser coding enough to effectively communicate with UX designers. engineers, etc. in a professional environment.</li>
                <li>Designing on screen will require understanding how users typically interact with content, where as on paper, the audience has less of a direct interaction with the physical peice. For example, digital designers should be aware of how a user intuitively interacts with a site.</li>
                <li>www.poketo.com is an effective site that is a modern lifestyle brand. It sells fun, abstract accessories. The design of the site is effective as the bright colors compliment its minimalistic integrity that its products echo. Consistency across the entire site realy allows the brand to be distinctive and memorable in the consumer's mind.</li>
                <li>www.skyscanner.com effectively communicates flight options by compiling all flights from different airlines from different purchasing sites. Consumers can easily filter through all options with advanced search functions that simplify the many different flight possibilities. Compared to other sites with similar functions, like Orbitz.com, Skyscanner delivers relevant information to travelers in a concise, straightforward manner.</li>
                <li>https://pitch.com is a presentation/slide deck assistant software that helps individuals create engaging content in the form of pitch decks. The website effectively sells the software by providing users with an intuitive, yet innovative experience. Motion and interactive pages show consumers what thew software will allow them to acheive in pitch decks. The site is effective because it impresses consumers with seemingly complex interactive features that the software promises to deliver in a simplified form.   </li>
